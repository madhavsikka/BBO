1. For running the code put the code and the datasets in the same folder.
2. Open the Face Recognition program in Matlab.
3. Run the program and input the dataset you want to test the algorithm.
4. The paramteres for the available dataset are set accordingly so if new dataset is to be tested in the if else part of the 
beginning of the code change the parameters and dataset accordingly. The parameters include the total no. of train points in dataset, test points in dataset, 
whether the dataset in rgb format, and train size per class and test size per class.
5. For each image in the test set an output window will be shown which shows the matched test image and matched train image with the information whether it is 
correctly classified or not. 
6. Depending on the size dataset the code will run for time in the range of 4 - 15 minutes.
7. Finally the accuracy of algorithm is shown in the end.
